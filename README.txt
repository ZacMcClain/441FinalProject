    The user can also press the 'q' key to quit the program.

Build Instructions:

    to be linked with the OpenGL / freeglut libraries and GLUI as well as GLEW.
    It also has a number of custom classes and files who sources can be found
    in src/ folder. main.cpp must also be linked to the header files for these classes
    found in the include/ directory.

	~/path/to/main.cpp $ make
	if( OS X or *nix )
		~/path/to/main.cpp $ ./keyToTheKingdom 
	else
